                <h2>Lachlan Franckx</h2>

                <p>Web developer currently enrolled at Bloc, a Front End Web Development 
                Career Path Bootcamp.</p>

                <p>My passion as a web developer is in learning the languages, 
                understanding frameworks, and how front and back ends work together.
                Outside of coding I enjoy surfing, rock climbing, and making music. 
                I am an avid adventurer and life long learner of things that inspire me.</p>

                <p class="description">Interactive quiz app that takes users through a series of
                questions and provides them feedback on whether the answer
                is right or wrong.  Also, updates the score and question
                number and calculates a passing or failing score, which
                results in a pass or fail screen prompting the user to
                restart the quiz.</p>
